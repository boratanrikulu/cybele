**Cybele** pron.: /ˈsɪbɨliː/ was an originally Anatolian mother goddess. Little is known of her oldest Anatolian cults,
other than her association with mountains, hawks and lions. She may have been Phrygia's State deity; her Phrygian cult
was adopted and adapted by Greek colonists of Asia Minor, and spread from there to mainland Greece and its more distant
western colonies from around the 6th century BCE.
